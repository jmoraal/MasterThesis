### Main todos
#TODO Implement better integration scheme! Currently use forward Euler (originating from stochastic SDE approach) with improvised adaptive timestep
#TODO Find reasonable parameters
#TODO Use NaNs in position array to be more memory and time efficient (note that dist computation is O(nÂ²)!)
#TODO adapt variable names to correspond to overleaf (or other way around)
